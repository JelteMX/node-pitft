node-pitft
==========

A C++ extension for node.js that gives JavaScript access to the AdaFruit PiTFT 320x240 2.8" TFT display (http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601).  The extension may work on other PiTFT models as well, but I've only tested it on the model mentioned above. 

For this extension to work, you need to install the FBTFT drivers by notro.  See the https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki page for details about this.
